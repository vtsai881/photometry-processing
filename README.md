# photometry processing pipeline
pre-process and plot event-aligned photometry data collected using TDT/Synapse software! compatible with [GuPPy](https://github.com/LernerLab/GuPPy) and [pMAT](https://github.com/djamesbarker/pMAT)

# key features
- reformat TDT exported csvs for easy import into pMAT or GuPPy
- align recordings to first TTL (for pMAT) or process TTLs for ease of alignment within program (for GuPPy)
- plot event-aligned normalized dF/F or z-scored data
